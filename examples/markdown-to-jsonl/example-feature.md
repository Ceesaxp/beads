# User Authentication System

Implement a complete user authentication system with login, signup, and password recovery.

This is a critical feature for the application. The authentication should be secure and follow best practices.

**Dependencies:**
- blocks: bd-5 (database schema must be ready first)

## Login Flow

Implement the login page with email/password authentication. Should support:
- Email validation
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Session management
- Remember me functionality

## Signup Flow

Create new user registration with validation:
- Email uniqueness check
- Password strength requirements
- Email verification
- Terms of service acceptance

## Password Recovery

Allow users to reset forgotten passwords:

- [ ] Send recovery email
- [ ] Generate secure reset tokens
- [x] Create reset password form
- [ ] Expire tokens after 24 hours

## Session Management

Handle user sessions securely:
- JWT tokens
- Refresh token rotation
- Session timeout after 30 days
- Logout functionality

Related to bd-10 (API endpoints) and discovered-from: bd-2 (security audit).
