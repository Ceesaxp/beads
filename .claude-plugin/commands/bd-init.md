description: Initialize beads in the current project
---

Initialize beads issue tracking in the current directory.

Use the beads MCP `init` tool to set up a new beads database.

After initialization:
1. Show the database location
2. Explain the basic workflow (or suggest running `/bd-workflow`)
3. Suggest creating the first issue with `/bd-create`

If beads is already initialized, inform the user and show project stats using the `stats` tool.
