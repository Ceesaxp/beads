{"id":"bd-1","title":"Implement full cross-type cycle prevention in AddDependency","description":"Expand cycle prevention in AddDependency to check for cycles across ALL dependency types, not just 'blocks'. Currently only 'blocks' type dependencies are checked for cycles, allowing cross-type circular dependencies to form (e.g., A blocks B, B parent-child A). This can cause semantic confusion and is a maintenance hazard for future operations that traverse dependencies.","design":"Implementation approach:\n1. Modify the cycle check in AddDependency (postgres.go:559-599)\n2. Remove the 'type = blocks' filter from the recursive CTE\n3. Check for cycles regardless of dependency type being added\n4. Return a clear error message indicating which types form the cycle\n\nTrade-offs to consider:\n- This is more mathematically correct (no cycles in dependency DAG)\n- May break legitimate use cases where cross-type cycles are intentional\n- Need to evaluate whether ANY cross-type cycles are valid in practice\n- Alternative: make this configurable with a --allow-cycle flag\n\nBefore implementing, should investigate:\n- Are there legitimate reasons for cross-type cycles?\n- What's the performance impact on large graphs (1000+ issues)?\n- Should certain type combinations be allowed to cycle?","acceptance_criteria":"- AddDependency prevents cycles across all dependency types, not just 'blocks'\n- Clear error message when cycle would be created, including dependency types\n- All existing tests pass\n- Performance benchmarked on large dependency graphs (100+ issues)\n- Decision documented on whether to add --allow-cycle flag or exception rules","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-21T20:45:01.433968-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T21:09:43.579707-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-16T20:31:19.174534-07:00"}

Do structured features (deps, tags, types) already provide better relationships?\n4.

Ensure daemon is running (bd daemon status)\n2. Run: bd compact --stats\n   Result: Error: compact requires SQLite storage\n3. Run: bd compact --stats --no-daemon\n   Result: Works correctly, shows statistics\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe compact command should work through the daemon RPC interface just like other commands (list, create, update, delete, renumber, etc.)\n\nImpact:\nUsers cannot use compact operations in the normal workflow. They must use --no-daemon which bypasses the daemon entirely.\n\nSuggested fix:\nAdd compact operation support to the daemon RPC interface, similar to how renumber and other operations are exposed.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-21T20:45:01.433968-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T21:09:43.580417-07:00"}
