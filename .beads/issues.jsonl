{"id":"bd-10","title":"Daemon storage cache doesn't detect external database modifications","description":"When bd commands bypass the daemon and directly modify the database (e.g., `bd import` with direct file access, or deleting/recreating bd.db), the daemon's cached storage connection becomes stale and serves outdated data.\n\n**Reproduction**:\n1. Start daemon: `bd daemon`\n2. Run bd stats → shows N issues\n3. Delete database: `rm .beads/bd.db`  \n4. Reinit and import: `bd init \u0026\u0026 bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl`\n5. Run bd stats → shows 0 issues (wrong!)\n6. Direct query: `sqlite3 .beads/bd.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues'` → shows correct count\n7. Restart daemon: `bd daemon --stop` then retry stats → now shows correct count\n\n**Root cause**: \n- server.go:1410-1414 retrieves cached storage without checking if DB file changed\n- Cache only evicts based on TTL (30min) or LRU, never on external modifications\n- Direct file operations bypass daemon, leaving cache stale\n\n**Impact**:\n- Users see incorrect/stale data after external DB operations\n- Confusing behavior with no clear indication cache is stale\n- Requires daemon restart to fix\n\n**Proposed fixes**:\n1. Check mtime on cache hit, invalidate if file changed\n2. Add cache eviction API (bd cache --clear)\n3. Use file locking to prevent external modifications while daemon running\n4. SQLite WAL mode change notifications","design":"**Better approach: Check DB file mtime on cache lookup**\n\nToo many commands bypass the daemon (import, init, renumber, compact, delete, dep tree, export, stale). Notifying from each would be error-prone and easy to forget when adding new commands.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. Add `dbMtime time.Time` field to `StorageCacheEntry`\n2. In `getStorageForRequest()` on cache hit:\n   - Stat the DB file to get current mtime\n   - If mtime changed since cached, evict entry and reopen\n   - Otherwise return cached connection\n3. Store mtime when initially caching\n\n**Code location:**\n- `internal/rpc/server.go:1410-1414` (cache hit path)\n- `internal/rpc/server.go:49-52` (StorageCacheEntry struct)\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Simple, centralized check\n- Works for all commands that bypass daemon\n- Works for external tools modifying DB\n- No need to update every command\n- Minimal performance overhead (one stat() call on cache hit)\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n- Small overhead on every cache hit (negligible - stat is fast)\n- mtime granularity may miss rapid changes (unlikely in practice)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-21T23:00:08.617147-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T00:08:01.197851-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-21T21:51:22.331957-07:00"}

What workflows would this enable that we can't do now?\n2. Is dataset size (typically 50-200 issues) large enough to benefit?\n3. Do structured features (deps, tags, types) already provide better relationships?\n4. What's the maintenance cost (embeddings, storage, recomputation)?\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n- Improve 'bd list' filtering with regex/boolean queries\n- Add 'bd related \u003cid\u003e' showing deps + mentions + same tags\n- Export to JSON and pipe to external AI tools\n\n**Decision:** Only implement if clear use case emerges.

{"id":"bd-44","title":"Add cross-repo issue references (future enhancement)","description":"Support referencing issues across different beads repositories. Useful for tracking dependencies between separate projects.\n\nProposed syntax:\n- Local reference: bd-128 (current behavior)\n- Cross-repo by path: ~/src/other-project#bd-456\n- Cross-repo by workspace name: @project2:bd-789\n\nUse cases:\n1. Frontend project depends on backend API issue\n2. Shared library changes blocking multiple projects\n3. System administrator tracking work across machines\n4. Monorepo with separate beads databases per component\n\nImplementation challenges:\n- Storage layer needs to query external databases\n- Dependency resolution across repos\n- What if external repo not available?\n- How to handle in JSONL export/import?\n- Security: should repos be able to read others?\n\nDesign questions to resolve first:\n1. Read-only references vs full cross-repo dependencies?\n2. How to handle repo renames/moves?\n3. Absolute paths vs workspace names vs git remotes?\n4. Should bd-183 auto-discover related repos?\n\nRecommendation: \n- Gather user feedback first\n- Start with read-only references\n- Implement as plugin/extension?\n\nContext: This is mentioned in bd-183 as approach #2. Much more complex than daemon multi-repo approach.

Ensure daemon is running (bd daemon status)\n2. Run: bd compact --stats\n   Result: Error: compact requires SQLite storage\n3. Run: bd compact --stats --no-daemon\n   Result: Works correctly, shows statistics\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe compact command should work through the daemon RPC interface just like other commands (list, create, update, delete, renumber, etc.)\n\nImpact:\nUsers cannot use compact operations in the normal workflow. They must use --no-daemon which bypasses the daemon entirely.\n\nSuggested fix:\nAdd compact operation support to the daemon RPC interface, similar to how renumber and other operations are exposed.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-21T23:00:08.617147-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T00:08:01.209733-07:00"}
